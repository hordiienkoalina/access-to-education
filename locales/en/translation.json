It measures how easy it is for prospective students to find a spot in a high-quality school nearby. Spatial access is calculated based on high school capacity, demand for classroom spots, and competition between schools. School quality is based on the IDEB, a government indicator that combines grade progression ratios and student test scores in standardized evaluations. The Access-Quality metric is displayed as a percentile within each state."

          "question": "Where do the <u>data</u> come from?",
          "answer": "The school data were gathered from the 2019 Censo Escolar, an annual survey of every school in Brazil. The data include various features such as the administration type (public or private), the number and education of teachers, the number of students, some infrastructure data, and the school's address. Only public high schools with at least one active class are included in the analysis, covering Municipal, State, and Federal schools. <br><br> The measure of school quality used is the Primary Education Development Index (Índice de Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica - IDEB), which combines information from the SAEB (a biennial evaluation conducted for every public school in the country and the government's primary metric for tracking educational achievement) and student approval rates. <br><br>Demographic and student location data come from the 2010 Census conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). The census provides extensive population data at the census tract level, the smallest observation unit comprising an average of 613 people. For each census tract, we identify the number of people aged 15 to 17 as the target population (prospective high school students). <br><br>Each dataset was the latest available as of Atlas Educação's development in 2023. Since the information is gathered from different sources with different collection dates, the access metrics might not be accurate when the population or schools in a region changed between surveys."

      },
      "colorRepresentation": {
          "question": "What do the <u>colors</u> represent?",
          "answer": "The colors represent the metric's percentile relative to other regions in the state. Metrics are scaled within each state to reflect how public high school policy and management occur at the state level in Brazil. In other words, each state ranks all regions by the metric and assigns colors based on their rank. Therefore, <strong><i>comparing between states is misleading</i></strong> because they are on different scales."

          "answer": "Parda(o) is an ethnic and skin color category used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in the Brazilian censuses. The term 'pardo' refers to Brazilians with mixed ethnic ancestries. IBGE defines 'pardo' as a person 'who identifies as having a mixture of two or more color or race options, including white, black, pardo, and Indigenous.'"
