      "answer": "The colors show the metric's percentile relative to other regions in the state (metrics are scaled to each state to reflect how public high school policy and management is done at the state level in Brazil). In other words, within each state we rank all regions by the metric and assign the color based on the position within that rank. For this reason, <strong><i>a comparison between states is misleading</i></strong> since they are on different scales."

IBGE defines the pardo category as 'For a person who declares themselves to be pardo or who identifies as having a mixture of two or more color or race options, including white, black, parda and indigenous.'"
